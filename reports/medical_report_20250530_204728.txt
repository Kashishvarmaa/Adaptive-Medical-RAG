DIAGNOSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diagnosis: Heart Attack
Confidence: high
Urgency: Emergency

Explanation:
A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, usually by a blood clot. Without oxygenated blood, the heart muscle begins to die. The longer the blockage remains untreated, the greater the damage to the heart.

Treatment Approaches:
- Emergency treatments: Aspirin, thrombolytics (clot busters), antiplatelet agents
- Procedures: Coronary angioplasty and stenting, coronary artery bypass graft surgery
- Long-term management: Medications to control risk factors, cardiac rehabilitation

Alternative Diagnoses:
- Pneumonia: 0.23 probability
- Asthma: 0.15 probability
